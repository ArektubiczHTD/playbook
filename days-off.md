### Why we need rules regarding requesting days off

We need to stay healthy and well rested to be productive. HTD will always be taking into account the team needs regarding staying healthy and well rested. 

Delivering software solutions requires teamwork. To deliver solutions on time we need to be acting effectively as a team. This includes coordinating days off so that we can be productive as a team and meet our obligations to clients.

When we sign a contract with a client we commit to delivering software on time. Our clients’ success depends on a timely delivery of solutions we work on. Unscheduled absence often puts projects at risk. Unscheduled absence, even if it does not put a project at risk, makes us look unprofessional and not organized well internally. This affects our reputation which is all we have and what we have worked hard to build. HTD is not office, desks or macbooks. It is our reputation.

### How to request days off internally

When requesting days off use Calamari. 

### When to request days off

Notify a client as soon as possible but no later than:

| How much ahead | How many days off |
|--|--|
| 1 week before | 1 - 2 |
| 1 month before | 3 - 5 |
| 2 months before | > 5 |
 
Letting a client know about your absence late does not give the client a warm fuzzy feeling. 

There might be times where we need more strict rules than the ones above. In such a case this will be communicated to you ahead of time. An example of this is when HTD signs a project that is exceptionally time-critical e.g. when a release must be done before some conference (or otherwise the client loses a whole year) or simply a client made hard commitments themselves and consequently negotiated such terms in a contract with HTD.

### Emergency

In case of an emergency call your team leader or Wojtek Z or Maciek Z.

### How to communicate days off to a client

A late news is a bad news. 

Do it in writing? send an email or tell a client while on a standup?
Tell it on a standup call or do it privately?
Notify a client over Slack? Never notify a client over Slack?

When telling a client on the call feel free to use the following phrases:


When notifying a client via email feel free to use the following phrases:



Always send a formal email to a client even though you the client might have confirmed on a call that is all fine. The formal email should be sent only after the client acknowledged the news told them on a call or sent over via Slack.
Create a calendar event title “<to be done>” right after you send the formal email. 


### Always use common sense

Whatever the rules are please always use common sense and be conscious. These are the questions that might help.

The phase of the project e.g. Are we about to ship a product we’ve worked on for a full year?
The relationship between the client and HTD e.g. Is this a brand new client that we’ve just started working for?
The time factor e.g. Is this the first week of working new client when we are in a trust building phase?


### What if more than one team member wants to take days off at the same time.

If a project does not allow for a simultaneous absence of more than one team member then we will apply first come first served rule and the request that was reported in Calamari later will be rejected.
