## Playbook

When reading this Playbook and talking to us you will often hear us referring to "warm fuzzy feeling" idea. You should have read this old [So you want to be a consultant...?](http://www.unixwiz.net/techtips/be-consultant.html) article and been given this presentation as a part of your onboarding to fully understand what we mean by that. The central idea in the article is this consulting maxim "You must give the customer The Warm Fuzzy Feeling". Whenever in doubt always ask yourself "Am I providing a warm fuzzy feeling to the client?"
